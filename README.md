# Shape Reconstruction via Level Set Method

## About the Project

This project is for implementing shape reconstruction program via level set method. It is based on a paper written by H. Zhao(2000).

## Algorithm

**Goal**: Shape Reconstruction from an unorganized data set.

**key Idea**: Want to find a function on an image whose zero level set is nearly the same as what we want to reconstruct.

To do this, we define a functional that measures how well a function reconstruct a shape. Let $S$ be an unorganized data set and $\Gamma$ be a zero level set of a function. Given a point $x$ on $\Gamma$, define $dist(x,S)$ and $E(\Gamma)=\big[\int_{\Gamma}d^p(x)ds \big]^{1/p}$. Then $E$ is non-negative and if $\Gamma$ is close to $S$, $E$ is close to 0. It means that $E$ is an appropriate functional for shape reconstruction.

To minimize this functional, we use Level Set Method. If you want more detalis, see the [paper](https://www.math.uci.edu/~zhao/publication/mypapers/pdf/surface1.pdf).

## How to run

There is one main file named 'shape_reconstruction' and 4 sample data for input. You can change the input in the main file. You also can change a hyper-parameter p.

## Result

Here are some sample results.

   <img src="public/fig2.png" width ="500">
   <br>
   <b>Case 1. circle(after)</b><br>
 </p>

You can see the red curve converges to the data points.
